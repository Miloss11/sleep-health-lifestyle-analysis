# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how lifestyle factors affect sleep quality and duration. We use a dataset containing sleep hours, stress levels, physical activity, BMI, and other health indicators.

## Structure
- `data/` - Raw dataset
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with analyses
- `src/` - Python scripts for data processing and visualization
- `reports/` - Profiling reports and outputs
- `app.py` - Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
- Run `notebooks/sleep_analysis.ipynb` for exploratory data analysis.
- Launch `app.py` to start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Ethical Considerations
Ensure data privacy and anonymization. Sleep data is sensitive; interpretations should respect individual differences and avoid overgeneralizations.
